# Wet Paper Dispenser

Arduino based robot that opens a lid automatically when the hands are close enough, so the user can take a wet paper in the restroom. It closes itself hermetically (thanks to the food container box from Ikea) and keeps the content fresh.

## The Idea 
Came when I got together with my girlfriend and I notoriously forgot to close the wet paper pack, thus she had some funny comments (concerns) about our future mutual life. Since I really love her, I needed to address these.

## Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- ADPS and VLN
- MG996R Servo
- 5V 3A UBEC + 5-30V power supply
